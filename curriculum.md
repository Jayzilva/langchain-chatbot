- Using The Graph for indexing blockchain data
- Storing off-chain data securely

### Hands-on:
- Host a decentralized website using IPFS
- Query blockchain data using The Graph

---

## 6. **Decentralized Identity (DID) & Verifiable Credentials**
- Understanding Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
- Working with Polygon ID, Entra Verified ID
- Decentralized authentication with Ethereum Name Service (ENS)

### Hands-on:
- Implement a DID system using Polygon ID
- Integrate ENS for domain management

---

## 7. **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**
- Introduction to DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Curve)
- Understanding liquidity pools & AMMs
- Yield farming and staking
- Smart contract security for DeFi applications

### Hands-on:
- Interact with a DeFi protocol using Web3.js or Ethers.js
- Build a basic token swap application

---

## 8. **NFTs & Tokenization**
- ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards
- Minting and trading NFTs
- NFT metadata storage (on-chain vs. off-chain)
- Fractional ownership and utility NFTs

### Hands-on:
- Develop and deploy an NFT contract
- Integrate NFT minting into a React app

---

## 9. **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)**
- Introduction to DAOs and governance models
- Creating and managing DAOs using frameworks (Aragon, Snapshot, Tally)

### Hands-on:
- Deploy a DAO governance contract
- Implement on-chain voting

---

## 10. **Cross-Chain Development**
- Understanding interoperability between blockchains
- Working with cross-chain bridges
- Developing with Cosmos SDK and Polkadot Substrate

### Hands-on:
- Use a blockchain bridge to transfer assets
- Build a cross-chain dApp

---

## 11. **Security & Best Practices**
- Common vulnerabilities (Reentrancy, Overflows, Frontrunning, etc.)
- Security audits and tools (Slither, MythX, OpenZeppelin Defender)
- Best practices for writing secure smart contracts

### Hands-on:
- Audit a smart contract for vulnerabilities
- Implement security best practices in a project

---

## 12. **Web3 Tools & Frameworks**
- Web3.js and Ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- Hardhat and Foundry for development
- The Graph for blockchain indexing
- Truffle for smart contract testing
- Moralis for rapid dApp development

### Hands-on:
- Build a full-stack dApp using Next.js and Web3 libraries

---

## 13. **CI/CD & DevOps for Web3**
- Automating smart contract deployments
- Setting up monitoring & logging for dApps
- Using GitHub Actions for Web3 CI/CD

### Hands-on:
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for Solidity contracts

---

## 14. **Career Path & Community Engagement**
- Contributing to open-source Web3 projects
- Engaging with blockchain communities (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos)
- Applying for Web3 grants and hackathons
- Exploring Web3 career opportunities

### Hands-on:
- Participate in a Web3 hackathon
- Apply for a Web3 grant or bounty

---

## Conclusion
This roadmap provides a structured approach to mastering Web3 development. The best way to learn is by building real projects, contributing to open-source, and staying engaged with the community. Happy coding!
